Lightbringer
League of Legends
Fellow armsmen, I ask you
"Will you follow me tonight to break their spine
And reclaim what once was mine?"
Those cravens, backstabbed me, deceived me
Never shall I tolerate their crimes again
Now let the hunt begin. (Yeah!)
Seven thousands souls, scared and daunted, such a tale of woe
Not too long ago, this village was a golden scene of hope
Call down the reckoning
To bring back hope and peace; restore our gloria
To live forever. (Yeah!)
Bring down the dark regime
I know how to unleash eternal power
Lead us to order
I am the Lightbringer! (Yeah!)
I am the Lightbringer!
Now listen, fellow warriors, I ask you
"Should my campaign come to an end?"
There's way more to avenge. (Woah!)
Fifteen million souls, living in this realm without much hope
Not too long ago, this kingdom was a golden state of hope
(Yeah! Ah, ah, ah, ah, oh!)
Call down the reckoning
To bring back hope and peace; restore our gloria
To live forever. (Yeah!)
Bring down the dark regime
I know how to unleash eternal power
Lead us to order
I am the Lightbringer!
(Woah!) Call down the reckoning
Bring back hope and peace; restore our gloria
To live forever
Call down the reckoning
To bring back hope and peace; restore our gloria
To live forever!
Bring down the dark regime
I know how to unleash eternal power
Lead us to order!
I am the Lightbringer!

Sabaton:
It's the nature of time
That the old ways must give in
It's the nature of time
That the new ways comes in sin
When the new meets the old
It always end the ancient ways
And as history told
The old ways go out in a blaze
Encircled by a vulture
The end of ancient culture
The dawn of destiny draws near
Imperial force defied, facing 500 samurai
Surrounded and outnumbered
60 to 1, the sword face the gun
Bushido dignified
It's the last stand of the samurai
Surrounded and outnumbered
As a new age begins
The way of the warrior comes to an end
As a new age begins
The ways of the old must apprehend
It's the nature of time
That the old ways must give in
It's the nature of time
That the new ways comes in sin
An offer of surrender
Saigo ignore contender
The dawn of destiny is here
Imperial force defied, facing 500 samurai
Surrounded and outnumbered
60 to 1, the sword face the gun
Bushido dignified
It's the last stand of the samurai
Surrounded and outnumbered
Until the dawn they hold on
Only 40 are left at the end
None alive, none survive
Shiroyama
Imperial force defied, facing 500 samurai
Surrounded and outnumbered
60 to 1 the sword face the gun
Bushido dignified
It's the last stand of the samurai
Surrounded and outnumbered
60 to 1, facing the gun
60 to 1, culture undone
